A basic match making program


Friend Finder
Welcome to the Friend Finder ReadMe file.

Purpose: Practice using Node.js and Express servers hosted through an external server (Heroku)

Help: Feel free to contact me with questions at joseph.vonedwins@yahoo.com

Contributors: Created by Joseph Von Edwins

Getting Started:
It's best to vist the deployed Heroku site at https://whispering-wildwood-27719.herokuapp.com/

The GitHub repository is located at https://github.com/joeyvon2434/friend-finder
but you probably know that if you're reading this file (lame joke, I know).

Summary:
Friend finder is an app that allows you to enter your name and a link to an image. You will then fill out a short questionaire and submit. The algorithm on the server will compare your responses to the responses of other users, and it will display an image and the name of the best match,

Potential Future Improvements:
This proof of concept requires and displays only basic information. It would be easy to add contact information to the matched friend as well. More complicated improvements would include adding user authentication, a list the top 5 (or more) matches, and a way to save matches. Internal site contact could be added as well.
